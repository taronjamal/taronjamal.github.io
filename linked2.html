  <h1>Autodidact Quotes</h1>

    <p class="quote1">"The Old Soul is more inclined to be a lifelong learner, constantly feeding his thirst for insight through his own persistent efforts.
        His learning has not been forced into him through education or learned out of obligation,
        but has been absorbed out of curiousity and personal choice." - Aletheia Luna</p>

    <p class="quote2">"One of the best examples of a polymath is Leonardo da Dinci.
        Born in Italy in 1452, Leonardo was a sculptor, painter, architect,
        mathematician, musician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, botanist,
        geologist, cartographer and writer. Although he received an informal education that included geometry,
        Latin and mathematics, he was essentially an autodidact, or a self-taught individual." - James Morcan</p>

    <p class="quote3">"My approach to being a self-taught programmer was to find out who was smart and who
        would be helpful, and these were - these are both men and women.
        And without learning from my coworkers, I never could've gone on in
        the profession as long as I did." - Ellen Ullman</p>

    <p class="quote4">"I imagine that one of the biggest troubles with colleges is there are too
        many distractions, too much panty-raiding, fraternities, and boola-boola
        and all of that." - Malcolm X</p>

    <p class="quote5">"Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school." - Albert Einstein</p>
